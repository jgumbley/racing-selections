                ~~ THE NAGS ~~~

    Being a set of scripts to obtain information
    from the internet about gambling markets in
    British horse racing.

    To analyse said data in arbitrary ways and
    present tips to the racing punter with no
    further comment.

    To monitor the effectiveness of these tips 
    with the aim of proving the null hypothesis,
    that the punter always loses.

    Concieved out of idleness.
